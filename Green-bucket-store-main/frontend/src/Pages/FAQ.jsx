        <h5>Can I add more than one delivery address in an account?</h5>
        <p>
          Yes, you can add multiple delivery addresses in your bigbasket
          account. However, remember that all items placed in a single order can
          only be delivered to one address. If you want different products
          delivered to different address you need to place them as separate
          orders.
